Tools I gained in my cp journey.
## Templates
### Fast Scanner
One of the most important tools I gained from the top coders in the community. I've checked the time and it is approximately 10 times faster than the Scanner class of the util Package.
## Algorithms
### Divide-Conquer
#### Quick Select
It literally saves my day when I have to sort something and pick up something as the result. This algo just as if targets a position (the interest position) having the answer to my question or atleast some part of it.
