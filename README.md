# Competitive-in-java
Tools I gained in my cp journey.
## Templates
### [Fast Scanner](https://shashwat0212.github.io/Competitive-in-java/Templates/FastScanner.java)
One of the most important tools I gained from the top coders in the community. I've checked the time and it is approximately 10 times faster than the Scanner class of the util Package.
### [Fast Data Structure](https://shashwat0212.github.io/Competitive-in-java/Templates/Fast_DS.java)
One of the main motive of learning different data structures is to see their compatibility with certain enviorment of application. The structures might not work as versatile as you expect it to but their generics can be modified for it to perform well. This "Fast_DS" (as boring as it sounds) is just a mere implementation of the vision of how you could merge multiple structures together to create an all end structure which performs well theoritically(I haven't tested this in real scenarios, might do someday) and how could we mould the structure as to our requirements. 
## Algorithms
### Divide-Conquer
#### [Quick Select](https://shashwat0212.github.io/Competitive-in-java/Algorithms/Quick%20Select/qs.java)
It literally saves my day when I have to sort something and pick up something as the result. This algo just as if targets a position (the interest position) having the answer to my question or atleast some part of it.
## Mathematical Background
After reading the divide and conquer part of the [clrs](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/) book the first thing that struck to me is that the maths behind all these proofs and assumptions and inductions were not completely meaningfull to me and I couldn't get enough of it just by some google searches so it came to me to first ponder over the "[Mathematical Background](https://github.com/Shashwat0212/Competitive-in-java/blob/master/Templates/Fast_DS.java)" of this stuff and it was just some high school maths(not the entirety).
