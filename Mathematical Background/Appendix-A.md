# Summations
## Divergent and Convergent
A series can be defined mathematically as a term of a variable (summation dependent) and constants. **If the summationâ€™s every term can be made to tend to zero by some value of variable then series is called __convergent else divergent__**.

<!-- let {1, $-\dfrac{1}{2}$, $\dfrac{1}{3}$, $-\dfrac{1}{4}$, ...} be a series then $a_n$= $\sum_{}^{} \dfrac{(-1)^{(n+1)}}{n}$

now, if n $\longrightarrow$ $\infty$ then $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{}{} \dfrac{(-1)^{(n+1)}}{n}$= 0 -->
### Analysis 
To analyze for a divergent or convergent function of summation we check : 
> * The rate of growth of numerator vs denominator (to check the degree of the equations) which if equal then convergent else divergent.
> * If the numerator grows much faster than the denominator then divergent.
> * If it oscillates(If it leads to nowhere) then divergent.
## Series and Sequences
### Set : A collection of anything.
> Example : { 1, 2, 3, 7}
### Sequence : A set with order.
> Example :  1 $\Rightarrow$ 2 $\Rightarrow$ 3 $\Rightarrow$ 7 != 1 $\Rightarrow$ 2 $\Rightarrow$ 7 $\Rightarrow$ 3 (Order matters)
### Series : If you add a sequence.
> Example : 1 + 2 + 3 + 7.
### Progression 
Sequence and series are progressions as they have a direction associated to them.
