# Summations
## Divergent and Convergent
A series can be defined mathematically as a term of a variable (summation dependent) and constants. **If the summationâ€™s every term can be made to tend to zero by some value of variable** then series is called convergent else divergent.

let {1, $-\dfrac{1}{2}$, $\dfrac{1}{3}$, $-\dfrac{1}{4}$, ...} be a series then $a_n$= $\sum_{}^{} \dfrac{(-1)^{(n+1)}}{n}$

now, if n $\longrightarrow$ $\infty$ then $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{}{} \dfrac{(-1)^{(n+1)}}{n}$= 0
